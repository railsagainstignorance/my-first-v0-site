# Second Post on the Same Day

This post demonstrates how we can have multiple posts on the same day, with precise sequencing based on the time they were published.

## Time-Based Sequencing

By including the full timestamp in the frontmatter:

\`\`\`
date: 2023-01-15T14:45:22Z
\`\`\`

We can ensure that posts are ordered correctly, even when published on the same day.

## Benefits of Time-Based Sequencing

1. **Precise ordering** - Posts can be ordered down to the second
2. **Multiple posts per day** - No confusion about which post came first
3. **Timezone support** - The Z suffix indicates UTC time, but you can use timezone offsets too

This is especially useful for:
- News sites with frequent updates
- Live blogs
- Event coverage
- Any situation where multiple posts might be published in a single day
