# Hello World!

Welcome to the first post in our blog. This is a sample article showing how Markdown content works with frontmatter.

## What's Frontmatter?

Frontmatter is YAML metadata at the top of Markdown files, separated by `---`. It looks like this:

\`\`\`
---
title: My Post Title
date: 2023-01-15T09:30:45Z
---
\`\`\`

You can add any custom fields to frontmatter, like:

- title
- date (now with time support!)
- author
- tags
- excerpt
- image
- and more!

## Markdown Support

This system fully supports Markdown syntax, including:

### Lists

- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

### Code blocks

\`\`\`javascript
function hello() {
  console.log('Hello world!');
}
\`\`\`

### Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote.
> It can span multiple lines.

Enjoy writing your content with Markdown and frontmatter!
